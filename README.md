This coursework was developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the dev server

After downloading the project to your local computer, you need to run the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the project dependencies. This project did not use any custom package, hence all dependency should be available through the npm registry.
Once all packages are successfully installed, run the command below to start the development server

```bash
npm  run  dev
```

You should then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
